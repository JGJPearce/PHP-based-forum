This application was hosted on my own personal web server, to access it you can
go to 'jackpearce.me' to get to the index page.

I have created some users with both high and low permission levels so that you could
test each of them, their logins are:
-Admin account	
	- Username: TestAdmin
	- Password: password
Standard Account
	- Username: TestUser
	- Password: password


The server also has phpMyAdmin installed onto it. To access it you can go to 
'jackpearce.me/phpmyadmin' and the login is:
	-Username: Jack	
	-Password: 123
